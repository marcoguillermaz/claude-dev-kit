# Humanize

Rewrites text to remove AI-generated patterns and produce natural, human-quality prose.

## Input

The user provides text to humanize. They may also specify a domain:
- `email` — transactional or relational email
- `contratto` / `contract` — formal legal/contractual document
- `comunicazione` / `announcement` — editorial content for an audience
- `generico` / `generic` — default when no domain is specified

If no domain is stated, default to `generico`.

## Process

1. Read the full input text.
2. **If no AI patterns are detected** and the text already reads naturally for its register, return the original text unchanged. Do not force edits on already-human writing.
3. Identify all patterns from `@references/patterns-en.md` and `@references/patterns-it.md` present in the text.
4. Apply transformations below, calibrated to the detected language (IT / EN / mixed).
5. Respect domain register: `email` = conversational; `contratto` = formal but not robotic; `comunicazione` = editorial voice; `generico` = match the surrounding register of the input.
6. **For very short input (<50 words):** apply only HIGH severity vocabulary rules and obvious opener removal. Skip sentence rhythm and structural rules — insufficient text for structural variation.

## Transformation rules

### Sentence rhythm
- Break uniform sentence length. Vary between short (5-8 words) and long (20-30 words) sentences within the same paragraph.
- Add at least one sentence fragment or rhetorical one-liner per 4-5 paragraphs if appropriate to register.
- Dissolve the "topic sentence - evidence - conclusion" paragraph template wherever it appears mechanically.

### Vocabulary substitution
- Replace every word or phrase in the HIGH severity list in `@references/patterns-en.md` and `@references/patterns-it.md`.
- Replace MEDIUM severity items when they cluster (3+ in the same paragraph).
- LOW severity items: replace only if removing improves the sentence, otherwise leave.

### Structure
- Remove unsolicited "Challenges" sections. Integrate genuine limitations inline if they appear.
- Remove "In conclusion / In summary / Overall / In conclusione" openers on final paragraphs. End by saying something specific, not by repeating the beginning.
- Remove predictable five-part essay scaffolding. Preserve the content, not the scaffold.
- Convert mechanical bullet-point lists to prose when the items are short and connected.

### Voice
- Remove all hedging phrases from the HIGH severity list. If the underlying claim is uncertain, express uncertainty with specifics ("I don't have data on this" not "Research suggests...").
- Remove vague attribution ("experts say", "studies show", "si ritiene che"). If there is no source, remove the claim or rephrase as the author's observation.
- Remove balanced non-resolution ("on one hand... on the other...") when the question has a defensible answer. Take the position the evidence supports.
- Remove unearned enthusiasm ("fascinating", "groundbreaking", "pivotal") unless the specific context justifies it.

### Anti-hallucination
- Never invent facts, statistics, sources, or arguments to replace removed AI filler.
- If removing a vague attribution leaves a factual gap that cannot be filled from the input text alone, remove the entire claim rather than fabricating a replacement. Do not insert sources, names, or data not present in the original.
- Technical hedging is not AI filler: preserve genuinely conditional claims ("this may improve performance under load", "depending on configuration") — these reflect real uncertainty, not AI patterns.

### Italian-specific (apply when input is Italian)
- Remove explicit subject pronouns where Italian drops them naturally ("Edoardo poi..." not "Edoardo poi lui...").
- Replace Anglicized constructions that don't exist in natural Italian prose.
- Fix heading capitalization to Italian convention (first word only, not per-word title case).
- Add colons where Italian prose uses them naturally — they are frequently underused in AI-generated Italian.
- Use impersonal "si" constructions where appropriate instead of explicit passive or explicit subject.

### Punctuation
- Replace em dashes used as generic connectors. Use commas, colons, parentheses, or rewrite the sentence.
- Do not use ellipsis for pauses or trailing thoughts.
- Introduce contractions (don't, isn't, it's) in English informal registers. Italian: use natural elisions.

### Exclusions — never modify
- Code blocks (fenced ``` or indented)
- Inline code (`backtick-wrapped`)
- JSON, YAML, frontmatter
- Technical labels and field names
- Quoted text (content inside quotation marks that represents a verbatim quote)
- Proper nouns, brand names, product names

## Output

Return ONLY the rewritten text.
No explanations. No list of changes made. No commentary.
The output format (paragraphs, headers, lists) mirrors the structure of the input — do not reformat unless the input structure is itself an AI structural pattern being removed.
