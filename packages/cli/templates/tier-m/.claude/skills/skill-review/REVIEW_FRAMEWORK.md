# Skills Quality Review Framework

**Version**: 1.2
**Created**: 2026-04-14
**Updated**: 2026-04-14 — cross-model review (Gemini 2.5 Pro + Mistral Large + GPT-4.1) integrated. 7 convergent structural fixes (C1-C7) + 3 single-model critical (T2.1 targeted / T2.3 / T2.4) applied.
**Status**: Consolidated - ready for execution once pre-work artifacts P1-P5 are produced.

**Purpose**: single source of truth for the quality review of all 18 CDK skills. Replaces any prior partial framework. Every check, decision point, and severity level lives here.

---

## Scope

The review validates each SKILL.md in `packages/cli/templates/tier-*/.claude/skills/` against:

1. **Anthropic spec compliance** - conforms to documented frontmatter and body structure.
2. **CDK scope alignment** - stack-agnostic, registry-coherent, pipeline-integrated.
3. **Internal quality** - checks are universal, severity calibrated, report template matches body.
4. **Cross-skill coherence** - references accurate, boundaries don't overlap, boilerplate intentional.
5. **Behavioral correctness** *(added v1.2)* - skills behave correctly when executed, not only when read. Validated via targeted behavioral fixtures on high-risk skills.
6. **External validation** - LLM cross-model review as recall booster (not verdict).

**Out of scope**: skill runtime performance, user preference.

---

## Severity scale — FINDINGS (review-time)

Classifies findings produced BY this review against each skill. Review-layer scale.

| Severity | Pipeline action | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | Fix before moving to next phase | Non-documented frontmatter field, placeholder unresolved at runtime, tool-instruction mismatch |
| High | Fix before Phase 6 (GO) | Pipeline↔skill misalignment, project artifact in skill body, cross-skill reference to non-existent skill |
| Medium | Fix or register roadmap with explicit decision | Boilerplate drift, model↔complexity suboptimal, Anthropic compliance opportunity missed |
| Low | Register roadmap, ignore, or fix if trivial | Minor token inefficiency, cosmetic drift |

### Severity mapping — review ↔ runtime (C5 patched)

Two scales coexist:

- **Review scale** (above): applied to findings DURING the review of a skill.
- **Runtime scale** (P2, used by skills themselves): applied by each skill at runtime to issues it detects in a user project.

**Operational definition of "aligned"**: two scales are aligned iff (a) they use identical labels Critical/High/Medium/Low AND (b) each label is defined by a criterion that is shared across both scales (severity of consequence + reversibility + scope).

**Fix-routing rule (revised)**:
- Miscalibration found in **1 skill**: fix at skill level (relabel the runtime severity).
- Miscalibration pattern found in **≥2 skills for the same check type**: framework defect. Fix the P2 scale itself, then re-apply to affected skills.

This supersedes the earlier "fix at skill level, not framework level" rule, which failed when the miscalibration was caused by a broad framework principle (Gemini §4 fallacy).

### User-pain dimensions on runtime scale (C5 addition)

The runtime severity scale (P2) is calibrated primarily on the target user's pain, not only on governance contamination. Each level must account for:

- **False-positive rate**: how often the check fires when nothing is wrong.
- **Actionability**: whether the user knows what to do with the finding.
- **Remediation clarity**: whether the fix path is obvious.
- **Invocation context**: whether the skill is clearly the right tool for the user's current task.

A check with high FP rate or low actionability cannot be labeled Critical even if the technical severity is high — the effective user impact is degraded.

---

## Pre-work (once, before skill #1)

Five artifacts must exist before any skill review begins. Build in sequence with STOP gate after each.

### P1 - Anthropic spec compliance checklist

**File**: `docs/reviews/skills-quality-review/anthropic-spec-checklist.md`
**Purpose**: actionable checklist with binary PASS/FAIL criteria for Phase 1 mechanical preflight.
**Content**: C1-C9 checks (required fields, documented-only fields, value validation, field combinations, body size, progressive disclosure trigger, placeholder resolution, runtime substitutions, dynamic injection).
**Status**: Created 2026-04-14.

### P2 - Severity reference scale (domain-neutral)

**File**: `SEVERITY_SCALE.md` (bundled with skill-review for export)
**Purpose**: reference scale that skills use to classify runtime findings. Domain-neutral (UI, security, API, testing, migration, accessibility).
**Content**: Critical/High/Medium/Low with criteria + user-pain dimensions (see above) + pipeline action mapping.
**Status**: Pending.

### P3 - Canonical skills inventory

**File**: `docs/reviews/skills-quality-review/skills-inventory.md`
**Purpose**: reference table of all 18 skills with metadata. Enables cross-skill checks, conditional Phase 4 gating, stable baseline.
**Content**: name, tier, line count, model, allowed-tools, registry flags, placeholder list, subagent usage, effort field presence, supporting files, behavioral-fixture target (yes/no per D1), pre-existing LLM review (yes/no per O2).
**Coverage check (T2.6)**: every skill under `packages/cli/templates/*/skills/` must have a P3 row. Missing rows block cycle start.
**Status**: Pending.

### P4 - Anthropic spec snapshot (one-shot)

**File**: `ANTHROPIC_SNAPSHOT.md` (bundled with skill-review for export)
**Purpose**: immutable reference snapshot of Anthropic skill documentation for the entire review cycle.
**Content**: source URLs, fetch date, full frontmatter spec, structural recommendations, compaction budget, substitution variables, dynamic injection syntax.
**Spec-change protocol**: if Anthropic doc changes mid-cycle, P4 regenerated + Phase 1 C1-C8 re-run on all prior skills. Treated as emerging principle under the freeze rule (see Retroactive re-application).
**Status**: Pending.

### P5 - Reviewer calibration kit *(new v1.2)*

**File**: `CALIBRATION_KIT.md` (bundled with skill-review for export)
**Purpose**: reduce reviewer judgment drift across the 40+ hour cycle.
**Content**:
- **Calibration set**: 2-3 historical findings with known severity, read before skill #1. Example: `Color.red` misclassification = Critical (project artifact + behavioral FP).
- **Anchor catalog**: 10-15 canonical examples covering Critical/High/Medium/Low across domains (UI, API, security, docs).
- **Drift indicators**: checklist of self-diagnostic questions to re-read at Phase 9 (midpoint).
**Status**: Pending.

**Sequential STOP gate**: after each artifact, user reviews and confirms before proceeding to the next.

---

## Cross-tier variations (multi-tier skills)

Multiple skills exist in parallel tier-s/tier-m/tier-l variants (arch-audit ×3, security-audit ×3). Rules:

1. **Inventory** (P3): each tier variant is a distinct row.
2. **Review order**: all variants of a skill-family reviewed in the same session. Order: tier-s → tier-m → tier-l (small to large surface). Findings on tier-s may propagate to tier-m/tier-l where identical.
3. **Cross-tier consistency check** (Phase 2.B, check 7): diff current variant against siblings.
4. **Expected-delta taxonomy (C6)**:
   - **Expected deltas**: scope (more checks in higher tier), verbosity (more examples in higher tier), tool-set (heavier tools allowed in higher tier).
   - **Unexpected deltas**: frontmatter drift, allowed-tools mismatch for same capability, severity label drift for same check, description divergence for same purpose, report-template drift without reason.
5. **STOP gate at end of Phase 2.D (C6)**: user reviews cross-tier diff artifact (column-by-column table) and approves propagation strategy BEFORE Phase 3 fixes execute.
6. **Phase 6 GO**: only after ALL variants of a multi-tier skill are green. No partial close.

---

## Retroactive re-application of emerging principles *(freezed per C3)*

During review, new universal principles may emerge that were not in the framework at start. Handling with bounded freeze rule:

### Entry criteria (new principle enters current cycle only if)

A new check qualifies for in-cycle retroactive application iff at least ONE holds:
- **(a) External spec change**: Anthropic documentation changed mid-cycle.
- **(b) Observed in ≥2 skills**: same defect pattern independently surfaced on multiple skills.
- **(c) Plausibly Critical at runtime**: the principle, if violated, would cause a Critical runtime failure in user projects.

Principles that do not meet (a), (b), or (c) are logged to `vNext-principles.md` and applied in a future review cycle.

### Hard cutoff

After skill #12 (of 17), only Criticals under rule (c) enter current cycle. All other emerging principles roll to vNext. This guarantees the cycle converges.

### Steps

1. **Capture**: codify as framework amendment (new check in appropriate phase).
2. **Memory persistence**: save to auto-memory type `feedback` with skill that surfaced it and reason.
3. **Retroactive application**: re-run new check against all previously reviewed skills (1..N-1). Bounded mechanical pass.
4. **Framework version bump**: append one-line changelog entry.
5. **Inventory update**: mark retroactively fixed skills as "re-reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD (principle X)".

---

## Per-skill pipeline

Six phases per skill + Phase 9 midpoint (runs once across cycle).

### Phase 1 - Mechanical preflight

**Executor**: Claude (no user interaction)
**Input**: single SKILL.md + P1 checklist
**Output**: list of Critical/High findings for Phase 3

Checks:
1. **Anthropic spec compliance** — apply P1 C1-C8 to frontmatter and body.
2. **Line count ≤ 500** — `wc -l`. If > 300, trigger progressive disclosure evaluation in Phase 2.C.
3. **Registry↔body coherence** — verify `requires`/`excludeNative`/`minTier`/`cheatsheet` in `skill-registry.js` match body.
4. **Allowed-tools↔body instructions** — grep body for capability keywords, cross-reference declared tools.
5. **Placeholder resolution** — every `[PLACEHOLDER]` handled by `interpolate()` or documented as user-fill.
6. **Model↔complexity alignment** — heuristic: line count + subagent usage + judgment steps.

**Fail handling**: Critical findings block Phase 2. Fixed in Phase 3.

### Phase 2 - Internal analysis + walkthrough

**Executor**: Claude (analysis) + user (interactive)
**Input**: SKILL.md + Phase 1 findings + P2 + P3 + P5
**Output**: consolidated finding list for Phase 3

Grouped by gravity. 2.A/2.B/2.C autonomous; 2.D interactive; 2.E targeted on high-risk skills.

#### 2.A — Fondamentali (block Phase 6 if failed)

1. **Frontmatter↔body coherence**: argument-hint targets/modes match body handlers.
2. **Project-agnosticity test — extended** *(D3 — 4 dimensions)*:
   - **(a) Literal contamination**: no example, file path, entity name, API reference tied to a specific project. Every reference is a placeholder or universal concept. Universal = applies unchanged across ≥3 of 6 CDK-supported stacks.
   - **(b) Severity habits**: severity labels not inherited from pilot project's domain. E.g., "any hardcoded color = Critical" is staff-manager habit; in non-UI projects, color is not Critical.
   - **(c) Remediation style**: fix suggestions not formatted/structured in pilot project's conventions. E.g., remediation always in "SwiftUI-like" declarative form.
   - **(d) Architectural assumptions**: no implicit assumption about routing, state management, persistence layer, auth pattern tied to pilot's architecture.
   - **(e) Default mental-model**: no framework-specific vocabulary ("View", "ViewModel", "@Published") or design pattern as default expectation.

   If a reader who doesn't know the origin project could ask "why this specific case?" on ANY of (a)-(e), it's an artifact.

3. **Output template↔body coherence**: every report row matches body check name + severity.
4. **Multi-stack + agnostic verification**: skill applies (or explicitly gates with `[web only]`/`[SSR only]`) across CDK-supported stacks.

#### 2.B — Coerenza strutturale (cross-skill + cross-tier)

5. **Pipeline↔skill alignment**: `pipeline.md` references skill consistently.
6. **Cross-skill reference coherence**: referenced skills exist, scope boundary claimed = actual scope (verified by grep of referenced skill's body + description), no overlap.
7. **Cross-tier consistency**: for multi-tier skills, diff current variant against sibling variants. Flag unexpected deltas per taxonomy above.
8. **Boilerplate drift detection**: reference = most recently reviewed skill of same section type. Flag identical-where-should-differ or different-where-should-match.
9. **Severity calibration vs P2 scale**: each severity level aligns with domain-neutral P2 per operational "aligned" definition. Cross-skill inconsistency flagged.

#### 2.C — Raffinati

10. **Token efficiency**: per-section token count (not line count). Flag sections >500 tokens that are not core logic.
11. **Failure path**: skill handles absence of prerequisites with stop-and-report, not silent no-op.
12. **Progressive disclosure evaluation**: if line count > 300, propose split into SKILL.md + supporting files.

#### 2.D — Interactive review

13. **Anthropic compliance opportunities**: for each documented feature not currently used, evaluate:
   - `paths` glob (if platform/file-type gating in body).
   - `agent` field (if explicit subagent delegation).
   - `when_to_use` (if description near 1024-char limit).
   - Dynamic context injection (if fresh-data-at-load needed).
   - Progressive disclosure (if >300 lines).

   Per opportunity: **apply now** / **register roadmap** / **ignore**.

14. **Section-by-section walkthrough**: Claude explains purpose + CDK relevance; user flags issues.

15. **Cross-tier diff review (C6 STOP)**: if skill is multi-tier, user reviews cross-tier diff artifact (column-by-column comparison showing frontmatter, tool set, check list, severity labels, report template across variants). User approves propagation strategy.

***** STOP — cross-tier diff approval. Wait for execution keyword before Phase 2.E or Phase 3. *****

#### 2.E — Behavioral fixtures *(D1 — targeted, 6 skills only)*

**Applies to**: ui-audit, visual-audit, ux-audit, responsive-audit, accessibility-audit, security-audit.
**Rationale**: these skills have the highest false-positive / behavioral-drift risk (browser-based, pattern-heavy, subjective).
**Skipped for**: all other 11 skills (document-audit sufficient).

**Procedure**:
1. Define fixture pack per skill:
   - **3 representative cases**: realistic inputs the skill should handle correctly.
   - **2 adversarial cases**: edge cases or known-tricky patterns (e.g., `Color.red` as SwiftUI system color for ui-audit).
   - **1 contamination probe**: input that tests for pilot-project mental-model leakage.
2. Execute each fixture against the post-Phase-1 skill in a controlled harness (small scaffold project).
3. Record: expected output vs actual output. Mismatch = High/Critical finding.
4. Consolidate behavioral findings into Phase 3 fix list.

**Output artifact**: `docs/reviews/skills-quality-review/fixtures/<skill-name>/` with fixture inputs + expected outputs + actual outputs.

**Fail handling**: behavioral finding severity:
- Critical: skill produces wrong classification (false-positive Critical or missed Critical on adversarial).
- High: skill produces right classification but wrong remediation.
- Medium: skill output is correct but low-actionability.

### Phase 3 - Consolidated fix

**Executor**: Claude (implementation) + user (confirmation)
**Input**: findings from Phase 1 + Phase 2 (2.A-2.E)
**Output**: updated SKILL.md + green integration tests + approved diff for Phase 4

Steps:
1. Present consolidated finding list grouped by severity.
2. User confirms which findings to apply (Critical/High mandatory, Medium/Low per decision).
3. Apply fixes.
4. **Rollback protocol (C2)**: if integration tests fail after fix attempt, try max 3 diagnostic+fix cycles. After 3rd failure, revert to pre-fix state and escalate to user with root-cause hypothesis + suggested alternative. Do NOT force-pass.
5. Run integration tests (`node packages/cli/test/integration/run.js`). All green required.
6. **Doc sync (O1)**: if fix changed facts in `README.md` or `docs/operational-guide.md` (skill count, capability claim, example), update both. If integration test counts changed, update README badges + inline counts.
7. **Token budget hard check (T2.5)**: compute post-fix token count of SKILL.md. If >5000 tokens, hard-fail. Either compact (move to supporting files) or revert governance additions.

***** STOP — Phase 3 → Phase 4 (C7). User approves fix diff before external LLMs see new version. *****

### Phase 4 - LLM cross-model review

**Executor**: external models via `scripts/external-review.mjs` + human adjudication
**Input**: post-Phase-3 SKILL.md (approved diff) + Phase 5 user-adjudication rules
**Output**: residual findings

**Pre-existing reviews (O2 + C4 decision tree)**:
- If pre-existing review exists for this skill (per P3 inventory): **always re-run Phase 4 regardless of skip conditions**. Override applies.
- Archive pre-existing review to `docs/reviews/archive/` with pointer to new review.
- **Quarantine rule (GPT anchoring mitigation)**: pre-existing reviews NOT shown to reviewer until after independent Phase 4 pass completes. Pre-existing consulted only for diff comparison post-hoc.

**Conditional skip gate** (only when NO pre-existing review exists):
Skip Phase 4 when ALL three hold:
- Line count < 150
- No subagent delegation (no `Launch` verb in body)
- No custom frontmatter fields beyond documented minimum

For simple skills (commit, simplify), marginal value low. Document skip explicitly in review log.

**For all other skills**: submit to 3 models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Mistral Large, GPT-4.1) with identical prompt.

**LLM adjudication rule (C1)**:
- Models produce **candidate findings**, not verdicts.
- A candidate Critical becomes BLOCKING only when:
  - (a) human reviewer verifies the finding against exact skill text AND
  - (b) either an explicit spec violation OR a failing behavioral fixture supports it.
- **Model agreement is neither necessary nor sufficient**. One model can hallucinate. Two models can share the same hallucination.
- **No single model can set severity** autonomously. Severity is assigned by human via P2 rubric.
- Candidates that don't meet (a)+(b) → logged as "unconfirmed, review at cycle close".

### Phase 5 - Residual fixes

**Executor**: Claude (implementation) + user (confirmation)
**Input**: adjudicated findings from Phase 4
**Output**: final SKILL.md + green tests

Same scrutiny as Phase 2 findings. **Emerging principle capture (O4)**: if a Phase 5 fix surfaces a pattern meeting entry criteria (a)/(b)/(c) above, trigger retroactive re-application per freeze rule.

### Phase 6 - GO

**Executor**: user
**Input**: Phase 1-5 complete + green
**Action**: explicit GO keyword. Move to next skill.

**Multi-tier skills**: Phase 6 applies only when ALL tier variants of the family are green.

### Phase 9 - Midpoint drift check *(new v1.2 per D2)*

**When**: at completion of skill #9 (midpoint of 17).
**Executor**: Claude + user.
**Input**: reviewed skills #1, #2, #3 + P5 calibration kit.

**Procedure**:
1. Re-read Phase 2 findings for skills #1, #2, #3 alongside P5 anchor catalog.
2. For each finding: ask "would I assign the same severity today?"
3. If drift > 1 severity level on any finding → recalibrate:
   - Identify drift direction (inflation / deflation).
   - Re-read P5 calibration set.
   - Either revise current severity standards to match earlier, OR revise skills #1-3 findings to match current.
   - Document decision in `drift-audit-<date>.md`.

**Fail handling**: if drift detected and unresolvable (calibration set itself ambiguous), pause cycle, update P5, user decides alignment direction.

---

## Interactive decision points (man-in-the-loop)

1. **Post-pre-work**: confirm P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 sequentially.
2. **Phase 2.D #13**: per Anthropic opportunity, apply/roadmap/ignore.
3. **Phase 2.D #14**: section-by-section walkthrough.
4. **Phase 2.D #15 (C6)**: cross-tier diff approval (multi-tier skills only).
5. **Phase 3 step 2**: confirm findings to apply before fixes.
6. **Phase 3 → Phase 4 STOP (C7)**: approve fix diff before external LLMs.
7. **Phase 5 confirmation**: confirm LLM finding fixes.
8. **Phase 6 GO**: explicit authorization to proceed.
9. **Phase 9 (D2)**: drift check resolution if drift detected.

All other steps autonomous once corresponding gate is open.

---

## Execution artifacts

Each skill review produces:
- Finding list (Critical/High/Medium/Low breakdown).
- Decision log for opportunities (apply/roadmap/ignore with rationale).
- Updated SKILL.md.
- Updated integration test count.
- **If in 6-skill fixture set (D1)**: fixture pack + expected/actual outputs.
- Optional: roadmap entries in MEMORY.md.
- **If emerging principle (O4)**: auto-memory feedback entry + framework amendment.

The `skills-inventory.md` (P3) updated per skill: pending → reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD with session link. Retroactive: append "re-reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD (principle X)".

---

## Review closing criterion (O3)

Cycle CLOSED only when ALL hold:

1. Every P3 row has status `reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD` (no pending).
2. All multi-tier family variants reviewed.
3. All framework amendments from emerging principles (within freeze rule) retroactively applied to prior skills.
4. `README.md` + `docs/operational-guide.md` reflect post-review state.
5. Integration tests green on final state.
6. Release note summarizing the cycle drafted (blocks affected, principles captured, severity mapping changes, behavioral fixture results).
7. **Phase 9 midpoint drift check (D2)** executed and resolved.
8. **All behavioral fixtures on 6-skill target (D1)** green.

Until all eight hold, cycle OPEN. No version bump claiming "skills quality-reviewed" can ship.

---

## Update policy

- Framework versioned. Bump when check added, removed, or materially modified.
- Pre-work artifacts regenerated when source of truth changes:
  - Anthropic docs → P1/P4 regen → trigger retroactive re-application of C1-C8 (rule (a)).
  - Skill count → P3 regen.
  - Severity model → P2 regen.
  - Reviewer team change → P5 regen.
- skill-review skill itself undergoes this review annually or on major Anthropic spec changes — dogfood.
- Emerging principles captured within freeze rule; rest roll to vNext.
