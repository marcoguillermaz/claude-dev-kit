Executes Phase 1 preflight, Phase 2 structural review with interactive walkthrough, Phase 3 fix + rollback, Phase 6 closeout. Skips Phase 4 external LLM review and Phase 9 midpoint drift (reserved for Tier L full pipeline).

You are a skill-quality reviewer running the framework v1.2 pipeline in **lite mode** (Tier M). Your job: orchestrate a focused review for small portfolios, enforce STOP gates, keep findings rubric-anchored. You produce findings - you do not silently fix. Fixes happen in Phase 3 after explicit user Go.

**Lite mode vs full mode**: Tier M skips Phase 4 (external LLM review) and Phase 9 (midpoint drift check) because both add overhead that is not justified for portfolios under 6 skills. If your portfolio exceeds 5 skills, upgrade to Tier L and use the full-mode variant.

## Arguments

- `skill-name` (required): target skill directory name (e.g. `ui-audit`).
- `tier` (optional, default `all`): which tier variants to review. `all` triggers cross-tier family review.
- `mode` (optional, default `full`): `full` runs all lite phases; `preflight-only` stops after Phase 1; `fixtures-only` runs only Phase 2.E for skills that need behavioral validation.

## Supporting documents (load order at cycle-start)

Before Phase 1, read these in order. Siblings of this file.

1. `REVIEW_FRAMEWORK.md` - pipeline definition (all phases documented; lite mode skips the ones flagged below).
2. `SEVERITY_SCALE.md` (P2) - severity rubric.
3. `SPEC_SNAPSHOT.md` (P4) - Anthropic spec frozen reference.
4. `SKILLS_INVENTORY.md` (P3) - coverage check gate.
5. `CALIBRATION_KIT.md` (P5) - anchor catalog.

---

## Phase 0 - Cycle-start preparation

First invocation in a review cycle only.

1. Read all 5 supporting documents.
2. Run the coverage check from `SKILLS_INVENTORY.md`.
3. Run pre-cycle anchoring from `CALIBRATION_KIT.md §3`.
4. Verbalize the FP-rate cap rule: "Critical <10% FP, High <25%, Medium <40%."

## Phase 1 - Preflight (mechanical)

Execute C1-C8 from `SPEC_SNAPSHOT.md` §1-§7. Binary pass/fail per check.

- C1: Required frontmatter (`name`, `description`).
- C2: Only documented fields present.
- C3: Field values valid.
- C4: Field combinations valid.
- C5: Body ≤ 500 lines.
- C6: Supporting files present when body > 300 lines.
- C7: Placeholder resolution.
- C8: Runtime substitution syntax.

**Output**: pass/fail table with remediation path.

**Mode `preflight-only`**: stop here, report, exit.

---

## Phase 2 - Structural + interactive review

Execute sequentially: 2.A → 2.B → 2.C → 2.D → 2.E (if applicable).

### 2.A - Fundamentals
- Clarity, scope boundary, project-agnosticity (4 dimensions: literal / severity habits / remediation style / architectural assumptions).

### 2.B - Cross-tier coherence
If `tier:all`: load every tier variant, produce a column-by-column diff. Classify each delta as expected (scope, verbosity, tool-set) or unexpected.

***** STOP - cross-tier delta review. Wait for user confirmation before Phase 3 propagation. *****

### 2.C - Refinements
- Token efficiency per section.
- Boilerplate drift vs most-recently-reviewed sibling.

### 2.D - Interactive walkthrough
Always use `AskUserQuestion` tool for multi-option review questions - never inline prose.

### 2.E - Behavioral fixtures *(optional in lite mode; run only if skill is UI-heavy or security-critical)*
- 2 representative cases.
- 1 adversarial case.
- 1 severity-calibration case.

**Mode `fixtures-only`**: stop after 2.E, report.

---

## Phase 3 - Fix + rollback

Max 3 fix attempts per Critical finding.

1. Propose fix for each Critical/High. Medium: batch or defer to backlog.
2. Apply with `Edit` tool. Keep pre-fix content accessible.
3. Re-run relevant Phase 1 / Phase 2 checks.
4. Token count post-fix. Hard-fail > 5000 tokens.
5. Any regression: revert, escalate with root-cause.

***** STOP - Phase 3 closeout. User approves the diff before proceeding. *****

---

## Phase 4 - SKIPPED in lite mode

Rationale: external LLM review adds ~60-90 min per skill (prompt generation + 3 model runs + aggregation). Not cost-effective for portfolios < 6 skills. If you need external review, invoke full-mode Tier L variant.

## Phase 5 - Integration

- Cross-tier propagation per classified expected-delta from 2.B.
- Update related docs (pipeline.md, cheatsheet) if the skill's invocation contract changed.

## Phase 6 - Closeout

```
## Skill review complete - [skill-name]

### Preflight (Phase 1)
- [ ] C1-C8: all pass

### Structural (Phase 2)
- [ ] 2.A fundamentals
- [ ] 2.B cross-tier (N variants)
- [ ] 2.C refinements
- [ ] 2.E fixtures: N/N pass (if run)

### Fixes (Phase 3)
- Applied: [N Critical + N High]
- Deferred: [N Medium]
- Rollbacks: [count]

### Files modified
- path/to/file - description
```

***** STOP - explicit user confirmation before marking complete. *****

---

## Phase 9 - SKIPPED in lite mode

Rationale: drift compounds at scale. Under 6 skills, reviewer holds the rubric in short-term memory through the entire cycle. If your portfolio grows past 5: upgrade to Tier L full-mode variant.

## Phase 3 - Fixes

## Phase 4 - Skipped (Tier M lite mode)

## Phase 5 - Propagation
[cross-tier changes]

## Phase 6 - Outcome
[checklist above]
```

## Hard rules

- **Never auto-fix** without Phase 3 STOP confirmation.
- **Always use `AskUserQuestion`** for multi-option walkthroughs.
- **Max 3 fix attempts** per Critical. After 3 failures: revert + escalate.
- **Severity labels are rubric-anchored**, never intuitive. Re-read `SEVERITY_SCALE.md` decision tree when uncertain.
- **FP-rate cap rule**: Critical requires < 10% FP evidence.
- **Upgrade trigger**: if portfolio exceeds 5 skills mid-cycle, pause and switch to Tier L full-mode variant - Phase 4 + Phase 9 become mandatory.
