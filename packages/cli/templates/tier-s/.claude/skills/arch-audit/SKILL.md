## Step 1 - Fetch latest Anthropic documentation

> **Parallelism**: Steps 1 and 2 have no data dependency. Launch the Step 1 research agent first (async), then begin Step 2 file reads in the main context immediately - do not wait for the agent to complete before reading local files.

Launch a single research agent **(model: haiku)** to fetch ALL of the following URLs and extract key changes:

- https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory
- https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings
- https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks
- https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp
- https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents
- https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands
- https://code.claude.com/docs/en/release-notes/overview
- https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases (latest 5 releases)
- https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models (latest model IDs and deprecation notices)
- https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices

From each Claude Code source extract: new keys/features, deprecations, breaking changes, best practice updates.
From the models page extract: current model IDs for Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, any deprecation dates announced.
From the prompting guide sources extract: principles for system prompt design, instruction clarity, context management, and what Anthropic explicitly discourages in long instruction files.

**URL resilience**: if any URL returns 404, try the canonical base `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/` to locate the current path. Note in the report if a URL changed. Do not skip a topic because one URL failed - find the current equivalent page.

**Expected current model IDs** (as of last research - verify against the models page):

- Opus: `claude-opus-4-7` (released April 16, 2026 - new tokenizer, `xhigh` effort level)
- Sonnet: `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- Haiku: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`
- Legacy (still available): `claude-opus-4-6`
- Deprecated: `claude-3-haiku-*` and `claude-3-5-haiku-*` (retired April 19, 2026)
- Retiring soon: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` and `claude-opus-4-20250514` (retirement June 15, 2026)

Flag any changes to this list in the report.

## Step 2 - Read current architecture files (run in parallel with Step 1)

Read these files in parallel while the Step 1 agent runs:

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `.claude/rules/pipeline.md`
- `.claude/rules/context-review.md`
- `.claude/rules/claudemd-standards.md` ← normative baseline for P1–P5 compliance checks
- `.claude/rules/pipeline-standards.md` ← normative baseline for Step 3e pipeline compliance checks
- `.claude/settings.json`
- `.claude/files-guide.md`
- `.claude/cheatsheet.md`
- `.claude/skills/dependency-scan/SKILL.md`

## Step 3 - Anthropic compliance gap analysis

Compare Step 1 findings against Step 2 state. For each gap found, classify it:

**AUTO-FIX** - apply directly without asking:

- Deprecated keys in settings.json with a direct replacement
- New settings keys that are clearly beneficial and low-risk (token efficiency, attribution)
- Stale file paths or descriptions in files-guide.md
- New hook events or agent frontmatter fields that improve existing patterns
- Deprecated model IDs in SKILL.md files or settings.json

**RECOMMEND** - list for user review, do not apply:

- Structural changes (splitting files, new directories)
- New features requiring user decision (sandbox, auto mode, new MCP servers, effort level `xhigh`)
- New settings keys that change execution model (`autoMode`, `sandbox.*`, `tui`, `viewMode`, `availableModels`)
- Changes that could affect existing workflow behavior
- Anything touching the pipeline phase gates

Every RECOMMEND must include: (1) specific file path(s) to modify, (2) section or line reference, (3) proposed change in one sentence. A RECOMMEND without a file target is incomplete - do not emit it.

**File target map for common divergence types** - use this when classifying findings:

| Divergence area                                                           | Files to update                                                                                                       | Classification                                                                        |

## Step 3b - Internal ecosystem consistency checks

**Execution strategy - two tiers**:

- **Grep-tier** (pure pattern matching, no judgment): C2, C4, C6, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13, C14, C15, C16, C17 - batch into a **single haiku subagent** that runs all commands and returns structured pass/fail results.
- **Judgment-tier** (require file reading + interpretation): C1, C3, C5, C7, C8 - run in main context using files already read in Step 2.

**Grep-tier batch** - invoke one Agent with `model: "haiku"`, pass these exact commands, and receive one structured result:

| Check | Command                                                                                                                                                                                  | Pass condition   |

Collect batch results, then run judgment-tier checks below. For each FAIL: classify as AUTO-FIX or RECOMMEND using the same criteria as Step 3.

**C1 - Deploy information currency (CLAUDE.md)**
Check: does the `## Tech Stack → Deploy` entry describe the actual deploy platform?

**C2 - Deleted file references (all skills, cheatsheet, docs)**
Expected: 0 matches. Any match = FAIL.
AUTO-FIX: replace stale references → `refactoring-backlog.md` for backlog entries; remove references to deleted files.

**C3 - files-guide.md: CLAUDE.local.md description is not live state**
Check: does the CLAUDE.local.md section in files-guide.md contain specific current content descriptions (e.g. "Phase 4/5 suspended") rather than a generic description of the file's purpose?
Expected: generic description only. Specific current content = FAIL (live state in static doc).

**C4 - settings.json ↔ pipeline.md worktree symlink alignment**
Run: `grep -n "ln -s" .claude/rules/pipeline.md`
Expected: 0 matches. Any `ln -s` = FAIL (redundant, potentially conflicting with auto-symlink).

**C5 - CLAUDE.md Worktree Known Pattern: reflects standard (not optional) usage**
Check: does the "Worktree setup" Known Pattern in CLAUDE.md describe worktrees as the **standard pattern for all functional blocks** (not just parallel development)?
Expected: language like "standard pattern for all functional blocks". Language implying optional/parallel-only = FAIL.

**C6 - Phase 5b dev server prerequisite**
Check: does Phase 5b in pipeline.md contain an explicit prerequisite to verify `[DEV_COMMAND]` is running before fixture setup?
Run: `grep -A3 "Phase 5b" .claude/rules/pipeline.md | grep -i "dev\|server\|localhost"`
Expected: at least one mention. Missing = FAIL.

**C7 - Cross-file path references (dead pointers)**
For each file path mentioned in CLAUDE.md and pipeline.md that is a docs/ or .claude/ path, verify the file exists.
Also verify directories: `docs/contracts/` and `.claude/skills/`.
Expected: all paths resolve. Any "No such file or directory" = FAIL.

**C8 - Interaction Protocol present in CLAUDE.md**
Check: does CLAUDE.md contain a `## Interaction Protocol - Plan-then-Confirm` section with execution keywords defined?
Run: `grep -n "Interaction Protocol" CLAUDE.md`
Expected: at least 1 match. Missing = FAIL.

**C9 - Pipeline STOP gate integrity**
Check: pipeline.md must contain at least 5 `*** STOP` markers (Phase 1, Phase 1.5, Phase 1.6, Phase 6, Phase 8 worktree cleanup).
Run: `grep -c "\*\*\* STOP" .claude/rules/pipeline.md`
Expected: ≥ 5. Fewer = FAIL (gate was accidentally removed).

**C10 - Worktree isolation rule present in Cross-Cutting**
Check: pipeline.md Cross-Cutting Rules must contain the "Worktree isolation (hard rule)" entry prohibiting staging merges before Phase 8.
Run: `grep -n "Worktree isolation" .claude/rules/pipeline.md`
Expected: at least 1 match. Missing = FAIL.

**C11 - Cheatsheet skill registry completeness**
Check: every directory under `.claude/skills/` must have a corresponding entry in `.claude/cheatsheet.md`.
Run: `for skill_dir in .claude/skills/*/; do name=$(basename "$skill_dir"); grep -q "$name" .claude/cheatsheet.md && echo "OK: $name" || echo "MISSING: $name"; done`
Expected: all lines show "OK". Any "MISSING" = FAIL.
AUTO-FIX: add a minimal row to the "Custom Skills" table in cheatsheet.md for any missing skill.

**C12 - settings.json hook integrity and hook type coverage**
Check: `.claude/settings.json` must contain all 3 essential hooks: `SessionStart` (audit overdue reminder), `PostCompact` (CLAUDE.local.md restore reminder), `InstructionsLoaded` (debug log).
Run: `grep -o "SessionStart\|PostCompact\|InstructionsLoaded" .claude/settings.json | sort -u`
Expected: 3 lines (SessionStart, PostCompact, InstructionsLoaded). Any missing = FAIL.
RECOMMEND if failing - do not auto-fix (hooks require verifying intent before restoring).

Additionally (judgment check in main context): verify that the hook configurations use the appropriate hook type. Claude Code supports 4 hook types - `command`, `http`, `prompt`, and `agent`. For reference:

- `command` - runs a shell command, captures stdout for injection
- `http` - calls a URL endpoint with event data as JSON body
- `prompt` - injects a text message into the conversation
- `agent` - spawns an agent to handle the hook event
  Flag any hook that uses `command` type but would benefit from `prompt` type (simpler config, no shell needed for static reminders), or vice versa.

Also flag any of the following new events from recent Claude Code releases that the project might benefit from adding:

- `WorktreeCreate` / `WorktreeRemove` - auto-setup / teardown logic when worktrees change
- `SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop` - logging or context injection for subagent calls
- `PreCompact` - save critical in-progress state before context compression
- `TaskCreated` / `TaskCompleted` - lifecycle hooks for task delegation (distinct events)
- `FileChanged` - lint/format trigger on file write
- `PermissionRequest` / `PermissionDenied` - permission flow interception (distinct events: request decides upfront, denied fires after rejection; return `retry: true` for alternative approach)
- `PostToolUseFailure` - recovery logic when a tool call fails after execution
- `Elicitation` / `ElicitationResult` - MCP server user-input request interception
- `ConfigChange` - config source change detection
- `CwdChanged` - working directory change handling
- `SessionEnd` - session teardown / final logging
- `UserPromptExpansion` - intercept prompt after macro/template expansion
- `TeammateIdle` - multi-agent coordination (notify when a teammate agent is idle)
- Hook type `type: "mcp_tool"` (v2.1.118+) - hooks can invoke MCP tools directly
  These are RECOMMEND, not AUTO-FIX.

Additionally, verify awareness of these recent Claude Code capabilities:

- `defer` value for `permissionDecision` in PreToolUse hooks (pause and resume via `--resume`)
- Hook output over 50K saved to disk with path + preview instead of context injection
- `if` field for conditional hook execution using permission rule syntax
- `once` field for single-fire hooks in skill/agent frontmatter
- `asyncRewake` field for background hooks that wake Claude on exit code 2

**C13 - context: fork on all skills**
Check: every skill SKILL.md must declare `context: fork` so audits run in an isolated context and do not pollute the main session window.
Run: `grep -rL --include="SKILL.md" "context: fork" .claude/skills/`
Expected: 0 files returned. Any returned file path = FAIL.
AUTO-FIX: insert `context: fork` after the `model: sonnet` line in any failing skill.

**C14 - CLAUDE.md is gitignored**
Check: `CLAUDE.md` must be listed in `.gitignore` (project convention: personal CLAUDE.md is never committed - exposes internal context, causes commit history pollution).
Run: `git check-ignore -q CLAUDE.md && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL"`
Expected: "PASS" (exit 0 - file is ignored). "FAIL" = FAIL.
RECOMMEND if failing - do not auto-fix (requires user to add `CLAUDE.md` to `.gitignore` explicitly).

**C15 - CLAUDE.md line budget**
Check: CLAUDE.md must stay within 200 lines. Beyond this threshold, Anthropic's own research shows instruction adherence degrades - lower-priority rules get silently ignored (hard auto-truncation at 200 lines per Claude Code docs).
Run: `wc -l CLAUDE.md | awk '{print $1}'`
Expected: ≤ 200. Any count above 200 = WARN.
RECOMMEND if failing: invoke P1 and P5 to identify sections to remove or convert to `@import` references. Do not auto-fix - pruning requires judgment.

**C16 - Deprecated model IDs**
Check: no SKILL.md file or `.claude/settings.json` should reference model IDs from Claude 3 family (retired) or Claude 4.0 family (retiring June 15, 2026). Retired as of April 19, 2026: `claude-3-haiku-*`, `claude-3-5-haiku-*`. Also check for any `claude-3-opus-*`, `claude-3-sonnet-*`, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, or `claude-opus-4-20250514` references.
Run: `grep -rn "claude-3-haiku\|claude-3-5-haiku\|claude-3-opus\|claude-3-sonnet\|claude-3-5-sonnet\|claude-sonnet-4-20250514\|claude-opus-4-20250514" .claude/skills/ .claude/settings.json`
Expected: 0 matches. Any match = FAIL.
AUTO-FIX: replace deprecated model IDs with the current equivalents:

- `claude-3-haiku-*` or `claude-3-5-haiku-*` → `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`
- `claude-3-opus-*` → `claude-opus-4-7`
- `claude-3-sonnet-*` or `claude-3-5-sonnet-*` → `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` or `claude-opus-4-20250514` → respective 4.6/4.7 equivalents (retiring June 15, 2026)

**C17 - `allowed-tools` frontmatter on MCP-dependent skills**
Check: any SKILL.md that calls `mcp__*` tools in its instructions must declare those tools in `allowed-tools:` frontmatter. This ensures Claude requests the correct permissions upfront before the skill runs, preventing mid-execution permission prompts.
Run: `for f in .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md; do name=$(basename $(dirname "$f")); [ "$name" = "arch-audit" ] && continue; if grep -q "mcp__" "$f" && ! grep -q "^allowed-tools:" "$f"; then echo "MISSING allowed-tools: $f"; fi; done`
Expected: 0 MISSING lines. Any match = FAIL.
AUTO-FIX: for each failing skill, read the `mcp__*` tool names from its body and add `allowed-tools: [mcp__tool1, mcp__tool2, ...]` to its frontmatter after the `context:` line.

## Step 3c/3d - Prompting Guide + token/subagent optimization

See [advanced-checks.md](advanced-checks.md) for the full content of these steps. Execute them before Step 3e.

- **Step 3c** - Anthropic Prompting Guide compliance against `CLAUDE.md`, `pipeline.md`, `context-review.md` + normative baseline `.claude/rules/claudemd-standards.md`. Covers P1 (content type inclusion test), P2 (instruction clarity), P3 (redundancy across instruction files), P4 (pipeline complexity proportionality), P5 (long context scannability). All judgment-based, PASS/WARN only, RECOMMEND never AUTO-FIX.
- **Step 3d** - Token & subagent optimization. Covers T1 (research agent haiku in Step 1), T2 (Explore subagent haiku across skills), T3 (Playwright concurrency note in Phase 5d), T5 (skill model fitness table). Mix of mechanical grep and judgment.

## Step 3e - Pipeline.md compliance check

Using `pipeline.md` (read in Step 2) and **`.claude/rules/pipeline-standards.md`** as the normative baseline, evaluate each pipeline phase and the Fast Lane against industry standards. Classify each finding as PASS or WARN (never auto-fix pipeline content - changes require user confirmation).

**Standards file currency check (run first)**: compare the `Last verified` date in `.claude/rules/pipeline-standards.md` against today's date. If > 30 days old AND Step 1 fetched material changes → flag as RECOMMEND to update the standards file.

**PE1 - Phase gates integrity (S1)**
Check: does every Phase have a verifiable STOP gate before promotion to the next phase? Phases 1, 1.5, 1.6, 6, and Phase 8 worktree cleanup must have explicit `*** STOP` markers requiring an execution keyword.
Run: `grep -c "\*\*\* STOP" .claude/rules/pipeline.md`
Pass: ≥5 stops, Phase 8 cleanup stop present.

**PE2 - Testing pyramid compliance (S2)**
Check: does pipeline.md define a phase ordering that enforces the pyramid (fast tests before slow)?
Expected order: Phase 3 (vitest unit) → Phase 3b (API integration) → Phase 4 (Playwright e2e). Any inversion = WARN.
Run: `grep -n "Phase 3\b\|Phase 3b\|Phase 4\b" .claude/rules/pipeline.md | head -10`

**PE3 - Auth boundary coverage mandatory (S2)**
Check: does Phase 3b explicitly require no-token → 401, unauthorized role → 403, valid role → 2xx for every new API route?
Run: `grep -n "401\|403\|no.token\|unauthorized role" .claude/rules/pipeline.md`
Expected: at least 3 matches in Phase 3b. Missing = WARN.

**PE4 - Type check before commit (S3)**
Run: `grep -n "TYPE_CHECK_COMMAND\|type.check\|tsc\|mypy\|pyright\|swiftc" .claude/rules/pipeline.md`
Expected: ≥1 match confirming a type-check step exists in the build phase. Missing = WARN.

**PE5 - Security checklist per API route (S3)**
Check: does Phase 2 include a security checklist covering auth check, input validation, no sensitive data in responses, access control enforcement, and row-level security on new tables?
Run: `grep -A8 "Security checklist" .claude/rules/pipeline.md | grep -c "RLS\|auth\|sensitive\|validat"`
Expected: ≥3 matches. Missing = WARN.

**PE6 - Staging-before-production (S4)**
Check: does pipeline.md prohibit direct production deploy without staging first?
Expected: ≥1 match enforcing the staging prerequisite. Missing = WARN.

**PE7 - Migration isolation (S4)**
Expected: ≥2 matches. Missing = WARN.

**PE8 - Scope gate before implementation (S1, S5)**
Check: does Phase 1 include both a Tier 1 / Tier 2 scope sweep AND an execution keyword gate before the dependency scan proceeds?
Run: `grep -n "Tier 1\|Tier 2\|execution keyword" .claude/rules/pipeline.md | head -5`
Expected: ≥2 matches in Phase 1. Missing = WARN.

**PE9 - Minimal footprint / no unrequested features (S1, S3)**
Check: does pipeline.md prohibit adding features beyond the approved plan scope?
Run: `grep -n "unrequested\|scope creep\|approved plan\|outside.*plan" .claude/rules/pipeline.md | head -5`
Expected: ≥1 match. Missing = WARN.

**PE10 - Fast Lane escalation criteria (S6)**
Check: does the Fast Lane define clear escalation conditions to the full pipeline?
Run: `grep -A5 "Escalat" .claude/rules/pipeline.md | grep -c "file\|migration\|shared\|consumer"`
Expected: ≥2 matches. Missing = WARN.

**PE11 - Documentation requirements gate (S7)**
Check: does Phase 8 require `docs/prd/prd.md` + GDoc update as a hard gate before block closure?
Run: `grep -n "PRD.*hard gate\|PRD.*mandatory\|no exceptions.*PRD\|PRD.*no exception" .claude/rules/pipeline.md`
Expected: ≥1 match. Missing = WARN.

**PE12 - Commit discipline (S8)**
Check: does pipeline.md specify the 3-commit block pattern (code → docs → context files)?
Run: `grep -n "Commit 1\|Commit 2\|Commit 3\|three-commit\|3-commit" .claude/rules/pipeline.md | head -5`
Expected: ≥2 matches. Missing = WARN.

## Step H1 - Hook compliance check

See [advanced-checks.md](advanced-checks.md) for the full content. Execute between Step 3e and Step 4.

Summary of the sub-checks:

- **H1a** - Event name currency against the official Anthropic event list (grep on `settings.json`).
- **H1b** - JSON response field compliance for prompt-type hooks (`ok`, `reason`, `decision`, `updatedInput`).
- **H1c** - Bypass mechanism visibility on blocking `UserPromptSubmit` hooks.
- **H1d** - Hook type fitness (`command` vs `prompt` vs `agent`).
- **H1e** - Rubric/hook drift between `prompt-quality-rubric.md` and inline hook logic.
- **H1f** - New events to consider since last audit.

Add results to the Step 6 report under `### Hook compliance (H1a–H1e)`.

## Step 4 - Apply AUTO-FIX changes

For each AUTO-FIX from Step 3, Step 3b, and Step H1: apply the change, note the file and line modified.

## Step 5 - Update timestamp

```bash
date +%s > "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/session/last-arch-audit"
```

## Step 6 - Produce audit report

Generate the report using the template in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/REPORT.md`. Include all check results from Steps 3, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, and H1.
