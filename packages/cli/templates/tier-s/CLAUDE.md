<!-- Format: pattern description → why it matters → how to handle it -->

## Interaction Protocol — Plan-then-Confirm

Before any action that modifies files, configuration, or external systems:
1. List every intended action and flag irreversible operations
2. Wait for an explicit execution keyword: `Execute` · `Proceed` · `Confirmed` · `Go ahead`

**Exception**: `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `git status/log/diff` are always free — no confirmation needed.

## Environment
- `.env.local` — never commit. Contains [list key env vars without values].
- [Any non-obvious environment setup.]
