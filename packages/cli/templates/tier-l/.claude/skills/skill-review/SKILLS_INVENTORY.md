# Skills Inventory (P3)

> **EXPORT NOTE**: this file is bundled as an example. Replace the inventory below with your project's skills before running `/skill-review`. The structure (summary stats + main table + coverage check) is the template - the content is a placeholder from CDK's own review cycle.
>
> **How to adapt**:
> 1. Run `find .claude/skills -name SKILL.md` to list your skills.
> 2. Replace the Main inventory table with your skills.
> 3. Update the Summary stats.
> 4. Adapt Review ordering to your priorities (start with the skill with the most known issues; put Phase 9 midpoint at the midpoint of your cycle).
> 5. Run the coverage check (§ Coverage check) to verify the table matches disk.

**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2026-04-15
**Bundled with**: `/skill-review` skill
**Status**: canonical inventory of skills under review. Gate for cycle start per framework v1.2 T2.6 coverage check.

**Scope**: enumerates every SKILL.md in your project. Each row lists tier variants present on disk. Variants absent from this table but present on disk block the cycle from starting.

## Cross-tier families (multi-variant)

Skills with 2 or 3 tier variants. Review approach per framework v1.2 Phase 2.B: review together, findings may propagate; cross-tier STOP gate at end of Phase 2.D verifies expected-delta taxonomy (scope, verbosity, tool-set).

### 3-variant families (S + M + L)

| Family | Expected delta across tiers | Primary variant for walkthrough |
|---|---|---|
| arch-audit | minimal - same check set across tiers; M/L may add ecosystem checks | tier-m (canonical) |
| commit | identical or near-identical across tiers (haiku model, same logic) | tier-m |
| perf-audit | tier-s simpler scope; tier-l full web+native | tier-m |
| security-audit | tier-s minimal (auth + input); tier-l full (RLS + response shape + headers) | tier-m |
| simplify | identical across tiers (haiku, stack-agnostic) | tier-m |
| skill-dev | identical across tiers (confirmed in review cycle) | tier-m |

### 2-variant families (M + L)

| Family | Expected delta M -> L |
|---|---|
| accessibility-audit | **identical by design** — same checks, same CHECKS.md reference; no differentiation needed (confirmed in review cycle C2) |
| api-design | near-identical; L may add contract-versioning checks |
| dependency-scan | identical (same 6 checks) |
| migration-audit | near-identical (same safety rules) |
| responsive-audit | near-identical (same breakpoints) |
| skill-db | near-identical |
| test-audit | M minimal; L adds coverage trend |
| ui-audit | M static; L adds sitemap-aware coverage |
| ux-audit | near-identical (opus model) |
| visual-audit | **identical by design** — content is optimal at current state; no differentiation needed (confirmed in review cycle C2) |

### Single-tier skills

| Skill | Tier | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| context-review | L only | Tier L is the only tier with the full 8.5 phase that triggers C1-C3 checks |

## Behavioral fixture targets (per D1: targeted)

Framework v1.2 D1 decision: T2.1 behavioral fixtures applied to 6 UI/security skills where textual correctness is insufficient to catch known defect classes.

| Target skill | Rationale |
|---|---|
| ui-audit | staff-manager `Color.red` case proved literal-correctness misses stack-sensitive defects |
| visual-audit | subjective scoring (10 aesthetic dimensions) prone to domain-emotion labeling |
| accessibility-audit | axe-core rule interpretation is judgment-heavy; false positives on hidden elements |
| security-audit | false-negative risk highest (missed invariant violation) - hard invariants need fixture confirmation |
| api-design | invocation context sensitivity (runs on routes that may not exist in all stacks) |
| migration-audit | destructive-op severity depends on deployment model; fixtures pin expected labels |

Per skill: 3 representative cases + 2 adversarial + 1 contamination probe + 1 severity-calibration case.

---

## Review ordering

Framework v1.2 recommends the following sequence. Rationale: start with the skill that produced the motivating defect (ui-audit, Color.red), cross-tier families reviewed together, single-tier last.

1. **ui-audit** (M + L) - motivating defect, behavioral fixtures required
2. **visual-audit** (M + L) - behavioral fixtures required
3. **accessibility-audit** (M + L) - behavioral fixtures required
4. **responsive-audit** (M + L) - UI family closure
5. **ux-audit** (M + L) - UI family closure
6. **security-audit** (S + M + L) - behavioral fixtures required
7. **api-design** (M + L) - behavioral fixtures required
8. **migration-audit** (M + L) - behavioral fixtures required
9. **skill-db** (M + L) - **Phase 9 midpoint drift check triggers after this skill**
10. **test-audit** (M + L)
11. **perf-audit** (S + M + L)
12. **arch-audit** (S + M + L) - **freeze cutoff: after this skill, only Critical principles enter current cycle**
13. **skill-dev** (S + M + L)
14. **dependency-scan** (M + L)
15. **simplify** (S + M + L)
16. **commit** (S + M + L)
17. **context-review** (L only)

## Coverage check (T2.6 - cycle-start gate)

Mechanical verification that this inventory matches disk state. Run before Phase 1 of skill #1.

```bash
# Expected: every SKILL.md on disk has a row + tier flag in the table above.
find packages/cli/templates/tier-*/.claude/skills -name SKILL.md | \
  awk -F'/' '{print $4 " " $7}' | sort
```

**Pass**: every (tier, skill) pair in the command output has a matching ✓ in the Main inventory table. Total file count = 39.

**Fail**: any pair present on disk but absent from the table blocks cycle start. Update the table first, reconcile the expected delta, then restart the coverage check.

**Also check**: no skill in the table has a ✓ for a tier that does not exist on disk (stale inventory).

---

## Versioning

Bump this inventory when:
- A skill is added, removed, or renamed in any tier.
- A tier variant is added or removed for an existing skill.
- A behavioral-fixture target changes.

On bump: trigger the coverage check again and re-verify the review ordering.
