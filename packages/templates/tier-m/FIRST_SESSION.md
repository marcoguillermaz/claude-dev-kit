# First Session Guide — [PROJECT_NAME]

Your governance scaffold is ready. This guide walks through setup and your first block cycle under the Standard Pipeline (Tier M).

---

## What was created

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project context — fill this in first |
| `MEMORY.md` | Active plan + lessons (updated by Claude, not by hand) |
| `.claude/rules/pipeline.md` | 8-phase development pipeline |
| `.claude/rules/context-review.md` | End-of-block compliance checklist (C1–C11) |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Hooks: test gate, weekly arch-audit reminder |
| `docs/requirements.md` | Product specification |
| `docs/implementation-checklist.md` | Block-by-block progress tracker |
| `docs/refactoring-backlog.md` | Tech debt tracker |

---

## Before your first session

**1. Fill in `CLAUDE.md`** — replace every `[PLACEHOLDER]`:
- Overview: what the product does and who uses it
- Tech stack: framework, language, database, auth
- Key commands: install, dev, build, test, type-check
- Coding conventions: any non-obvious rules for your codebase

**2. Fill in `docs/requirements.md`** — list the blocks you plan to implement, in priority order. Even a rough list is enough to start.

**3. Verify your test command works**:
```bash
[TEST_COMMAND]
```
It must exit 0 before Claude can declare any task complete (enforced by the Stop hook in `.claude/settings.json`).

---

## Your first Claude session

```bash
claude
```

Claude reads `CLAUDE.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and `.claude/rules/pipeline.md` at startup. It will orient itself in Phase 0 automatically — create a session recovery file, check the branch, align on context.

**Starting a new block:**

```
Start a new block: [describe what you want to build in one sentence]
```

Claude will:
1. Create `.claude/session/block-[name].md` — a recovery file if the session is interrupted
2. Read `docs/requirements.md` and `docs/implementation-checklist.md`
3. Conduct a scope review (Phase 1) — answer its clarifying questions
4. Wait for your explicit confirmation before writing any code

**Execution keywords** — the only phrases that authorize autonomous action after a STOP gate:

> `Execute` · `Proceed` · `Confirmed` · `Go ahead`

Read-only operations (Read, Grep, git status/log) always run without confirmation.

## The 8-phase pipeline

| Phase | What happens | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Session orientation | Session file, branch check, context alignment | — |
| 1 — Requirements | Scope review (Tier 1 or Tier 2) + dependency scan | ⏸ STOP |
| 1.5 — Design review | Data flow + trade-offs (blocks >5 files or new patterns) | ⏸ STOP |
| 2 — Implementation | Code + security checklist | — |
| 3 — Build + unit tests | Type check, build, unit tests | — |
| 3b — API integration tests | Auth, authz, validation, business rules (if API routes touched) | — |
| 4 — E2E tests | Playwright/Cypress (if configured + UI flows confirmed) | — |
| 5b — Test data setup | Representative records for smoke test | — |
| 5c — Staging deploy | Merge to staging + smoke test | — |
| 6 — Outcome checklist | Full verification report | ⏸ STOP |
| 8 — Block closure | Session file deleted, docs updated, 3-commit sequence | — |
| 8.5 — Context review | C1–C11 checks + `/compact` | — |

**STOP gates** are hard stops — Claude waits for your explicit confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Scope gate: Tier 1 vs Tier 2

At Phase 1, Claude auto-selects a sweep depth based on block complexity:

| Signal | Tier |
|---|---|
| ≤5 files, single entity, no migration | Tier 1 — Standard Sweep |
| >5 files, new entity, migration, or multi-role change | Tier 2 — Deep Sweep |

You can always override the selection. The Tier 2 sweep adds EARS-style analysis (WHEN/IF/WHILE/WHERE dimensions) and a pre-mortem.

---

## Key commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/arch-audit` | Audits governance files vs. latest Anthropic docs (run weekly) |
| `/security-audit` | Reviews API routes and auth guards |
| `/skill-dev` | Code quality and tech debt audit |
| `/compact` | Frees context window (run at Phase 8.5) |
| `npx claude-dev-kit doctor` | Checks your governance setup |

---

## Recovery

- **Session interrupted?** `.claude/session/block-*.md` has the recovery state. Start Claude — it reads the file and resumes automatically.
- **Tests failing?** Claude cannot declare completion. Fix tests or use `git stash` to isolate.
- **Scope expanded?** Return to Phase 1 — any scope change must be confirmed before implementation continues.
