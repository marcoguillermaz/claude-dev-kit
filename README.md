> Scaffold for legible, reviewable AI-assisted development.
> Claude generates. Your team decides.
> MCP-native — read CDK governance state from Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, VS Code.

Claude Code is a powerful CLI that reads, writes, and reasons about your entire codebase. Without shared process, it makes autonomous decisions that are hard to track and harder to review.

**claude-dev-kit** scaffolds a structured, reviewable development process on top of Claude Code. It enforces one non-negotiable rule mechanically: Claude cannot declare a task complete until your tests pass. Everything else scales with your needs.

Since v1.17.0, CDK ships an MCP server alongside the CLI. Any MCP-aware client can read your project's doctor report, team-settings policy, last arch-audit, and skill inventory without anyone running the CDK CLI. See [MCP server](#mcp-server).

## Quick Start

```bash
npx mg-claude-dev-kit init
```

The wizard detects your project state and guides you through setup. Three paths available:

| Path                   | Use when                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Existing project**   | Add structure to a project that already has code                 |
| **New project**        | Starting from scratch                                            |
| **From existing docs** | Share repos or docs - Claude reads them and populates everything |

After init, open Claude Code and start working. The scaffold is active immediately.

## What it does

### Tiered pipelines matched to risk

| Tier              | Pipeline                | Best for                              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **0 - Discovery** | Stop hook only          | First exploration - zero process      |
| **S - Fast Lane** | 4 steps, scope-confirm  | Single dev, low risk, quick fixes     |
| **M - Standard**  | 8 phases, 2 STOP gates  | Feature blocks, 1-2 collaborators     |
| **L - Full**      | 14 phases, 4 STOP gates | Team projects, complex domain changes |

Start at Tier 0. Move up when you need more structure: `npx mg-claude-dev-kit upgrade --tier=m`

### 22 audit skills

Executable multi-step programs that run inside Claude Code. Not prompt instructions - structured audit workflows with model routing (haiku for mechanical checks, sonnet for analysis).

| Skill                  | Tiers | Purpose                                                                                                                                 |

| `/api-contract-audit`  | M L   | OpenAPI contract drift (endpoints, schemas, status), breaking-change detection vs previous spec, versioning consistency, security scheme alignment, Richardson Maturity L0-L3 scoring. Auto-gen for FastAPI / NestJS / Express+swagger-jsdoc / Next.js route handlers / Django REST. |
| `/infra-audit`         | M L   | Infrastructure security across GitHub Actions (pwn-request, secret logging, pinning, permissions), Dockerfile (root, latest tag, URL add), K8s (runAsNonRoot, privileged, hostNetwork), Terraform (IAM wildcards, state in git), GitLab CI. Stack-agnostic. |

Stack-aware (node-ts/python/swift); agnostic fallback for other stacks. Audit-only in v1; mutating apply-tier-a deferred to Q4. **MCP-aware (v1.20+)**: Step 2 queries `package-registry-mcp` for multi-ecosystem package metadata with WebFetch fallback. |
| `/pr-review`           | M L   | Autonomous local PR review via gh CLI: spawns review subagent on the diff, classifies findings (Critical / Major / Minor) using universal + stack-specific severity criteria, posts review as PR comment for audit trail. Configurable via team-settings.json `prReviewSeverity`. Read-only. `--deep` escalates to opus for sensitive changes. Also exposed as `cdk_pr_review` MCP tool. |
| `/skill-review`        | M L   | Quality review pipeline for skill portfolios. Spec compliance, cross-tier coherence, behavioral fixtures.                               |

Skills are conditionally installed based on your project: `hasApi`, `hasDatabase`, `hasFrontend`, `hasDesignSystem`.

### 11 tech stacks auto-detected

Node.js/TS, Node.js/JS, Python, Go, Swift, Kotlin, Rust, .NET, Ruby, Java - plus generic fallback. Security rules, permissions, and CLAUDE.md fields adapt automatically.

### MCP server (v1.17.0+)

The `mg-claude-dev-kit` package ships an MCP server (`claude-dev-kit-mcp` binary) alongside the CLI, version-locked, single `npm install -g`. Any MCP-aware client (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Copilot Studio) can query CDK governance state without the CDK CLI running. Five read-only tools cover doctor report, team-settings, last arch-audit, skill inventory, and package metadata. Full reference in the [MCP server](#mcp-server) section below.

### Incremental adoption

Install individual components without a full scaffold:

```bash
npx mg-claude-dev-kit add skill security-audit   # install one skill
npx mg-claude-dev-kit add rule git                # install one rule
npx mg-claude-dev-kit add rule security --stack swift  # stack-specific variant
```

Custom skills (`custom-*` prefix) are preserved across upgrades. See [Custom Skills Guide](docs/custom-skills.md).

The Stop hook in `settings.json` is the core enforcement mechanism. It blocks Claude from completing any task until tests pass. Present in every tier, including Discovery.

```

## MCP server

`claude-dev-kit-mcp` is a Model Context Protocol server that exposes CDK governance signals to any MCP-aware client (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Copilot Studio). The CLI and MCP server ship in the same npm package, version-locked.

Wire it up by adding to `.mcp.json` (project-scoped) or `~/.claude/.mcp.json` (user-scoped):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cdk": { "command": "claude-dev-kit-mcp" }
  }
}
```

Read-only tools exposed:

| Tool | Returns |
| ---- | ------- |
| `cdk_doctor_report` | `doctor --report` JSON (28 checks) |
| `cdk_team_settings` | parsed `.claude/team-settings.json` |
| `cdk_arch_audit_status` | last `arch-audit` run timestamp + age |
| `cdk_skill_inventory` | installed skills + frontmatter snapshot |
| `cdk_package_meta` | CDK package name, version, CLI path, cwd |
| `cdk_pr_review` | reads existing `/pr-review` skill comments on a GitHub PR (verdict, severity counts). Read-only — to generate a fresh review, invoke the `/pr-review` CDK skill. |

The server resolves the project root from `$CDK_PROJECT_ROOT` if set, otherwise from `process.cwd()`. No mutating tools in v1.17.0 by design.

---

## Process controls

**Stop hook** (every tier) - Claude cannot declare done until tests pass:

```json
"Stop": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command",
  "command": "npm test || echo '{\"decision\": \"block\", \"reason\": \"Tests must pass.\"}'"
}] }]
```

**STOP gates** (Tier M/L) - Requirements reviewed before implementation. Spec-first or scope-confirm mode auto-selected per block.

**Audit logging** - Every tool use appended to `~/.claude/audit/project.jsonl`.

**AI attribution** - Every Claude-assisted commit tagged with `Co-authored-by`.

**Weekly arch-audit** - SessionStart hook checks if `/arch-audit` ran in the last 7 days.

**CODEOWNERS** - Changes to `.claude/` require tech lead review.

---

## Testing

```bash
node packages/cli/test/integration/run.js    # 1129 integration checks
node --test packages/cli/test/unit/*.test.js   # 373 unit tests
```

Covers: file structure per tier, Stop hook presence, pipeline gate counts, placeholder resolution, skill pruning, security variant selection, native stack adaptation, rubric scoring, cross-stack content invariants (10 stacks), golden-file assertions (Swift, Node-TS, Python), full CLI execution via `--answers` fixtures.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22
- [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code)
- Git

## Roadmap

See [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/marcoguillermaz/claude-dev-kit/milestones) for the 12-month plan.

**Current**: v1.22.0 ships the **`/skill-dev` v2 hotspot enhancement** — the differentiating piece of the closed `/debt-triage` sub-track (Issue #97 sub-track 2), folded into `/skill-dev` per the 2026-04-28 cross-LLM verdict. New Step 3b "Hotspot priority (churn × debt)" intersects per-file debt count with `git log --since="6.months.ago" --numstat` churn data, ranks files into a 4-quadrant matrix (Q1 hot mess / Q2 stable rot / Q3 flaky frontier / Q4 cold corner), and renders a top-10 hotspot table in the audit report. The hotspot section does NOT change which findings get added to the backlog (Step 4 still applies the same severity rules) — it re-orders backlog work by leverage. Stack-agnostic; gracefully skips on non-Git projects or projects with insufficient signal. Integration: 1129 checks (+15 from `scenarioSkillDevHotspot`). The v1.21.0 PreToolUse runtime enforcement remains in place; v1.20.0 MCP-aware audit skills (`/security-audit` + `/dependency-audit`) remain pinned to `mcp-nvd` and `package-registry-mcp`.

**Next**: `/arch-audit` MCP-aware once the upstream Anthropic spec MCP server lands. `/privacy-audit` re-eval (Issue #97 sub-track 3) when AST tracing matures or demand signal materializes. Q2 #3 VitePress docs site (ICE 432) stays on hold.
